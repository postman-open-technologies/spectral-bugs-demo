# Recursive descent `parent..[?(@.something filter)]` ignores first level

In Spectral, a given path containing `parent..[?(@.something filter)]` will only find elements beyond the first level of parent. Any other path using `..` includes the first level.

- `$..type` ‚úÖ
- `$..[?(@property == "type")]` ‚úÖ
- `$..[?(@property.match("type"))]` ‚úÖ  
- `$..[?(@.type == "object")]` ‚ùå
- `$..[?(@property == "type" && @ == "object")]` ‚úÖ 

# Issue

A Spectral rule using a path such as `$.components.schemas.*..[?(@.type=="array")]` to detect arrays in reusable schemas in an OpenAPI document will not detect first level arrays.

```
openapi: "3.1.0"
info:
  title: An API
  version: "1.0"
components:
  schemas:
    SchemaArray: # Not found
      type: array
      items:
        type: object
    SchemaObject:
      type: object
      properties:
        aPropertyArray: # Found 
          type: array
```

A rule using similar path without filter like `$.components.schemas.*..type` will detect all elements.

```
openapi: "3.1.0"
info:
  title: An API
  version: "1.0"
components:
  schemas:
    SchemaBoolean:
      type: boolean # Found
    SchemaObject:
      properties:
        aBooleanProperty:
          type: boolean # Found
```
# Workarounds

Original path:

```
given:
  - $.components.schemas.*..[?(@.type=="array")]
```

Unit test: `npm run test -- --rule recursive-descent-and-filter-bug`

## Adding a path targeting first level

Adding a path specifically targeting first level may fix the problem.
This work around is not application at `$` level as `$[?(@.something filter)]` doesn't seem to work.

```
given:
  - $.components.schemas.[?(@.type=="array")]
  - $.components.schemas.*..[?(@.type=="array")]
```

Unit tests: `npm run test -- --rule recursive-descent-and-filter-work-around-1`

## Moving one level up

Moving one level up may fix the problem.
This work around is not application at `$` level as `$[?(@.something filter)]` doesn't seem to work.

```
given:
  - $.components.schemas..[?(@.type=="array")]
```

Unit tests: `npm run test -- --rule recursive-descent-and-filter-work-around-2`


## Use @property

Replace @.something by a filter based on property name (`@property`) and value (`@`) and take parent (`^`).
Not applicable if the filter is `@.something.match(regex)`

```
given:
  - $.components.schemas..[?(@property=="type" && @ == "array")]^
```

Unit tests: `npm run test -- --rule recursive-descent-and-filter-work-around-3`

## Unit test for rule demonstrating the problem

Run unit test only for bug: `npm run recursive-descent-ignores-first-level-bug-unit-test`
